## Elasticity Equation

## Introduction

The Elasticity Equation is a set of equations used to model Elasticity, the property of Solid Materials to return to their original shape and size after the Forces Deforming them have been removed.

## Requirements

1. Compiler: `g++ (9.4.0)`.
2. OS: `Ubuntu 20.04`.
3. `CMake`.
4. Text Editor: Any will do; `Sublime Text` was used.
5. [Paravview](https://www.paraview.org/) for viewing images.

## Instructions

          $ git clone https://github.com/MRLintern/Partial-Differential-Equations_deal.II.git
          $ cd Elasticity-Equation
          $ mkdir build && cd build
          $ cmake ..
          $ cmake --build .
          $ ./elastic
          
          Viewing images: start Paraview:
          
          $ paraview &
          
          Go to file tab and then find your image(s) in the working directory.
